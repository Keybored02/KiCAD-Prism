"""The agent finding a project by its marker instead of by comparing paths.

The bug this replaces: the agent asked the server for every project's `path` and
string-compared it against the local one. That is only ever correct when the server
and the client are the same machine. These tests pin the new behaviour, and in
particular the two cases where marker-matching and path-matching disagree.
