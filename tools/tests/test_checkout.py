"""Moving a working tree to a specific revision, without destroying anything.

The rule every one of these tests is really about: **never destroy work the user cannot
get back.** A commit is recoverable from git. An uncommitted edit to a board is not.

So anything that would discard uncommitted changes is REFUSED, with a reason, rather
than done with a warning. `git checkout` itself is not this careful: it will carry dirty
files onto another branch, and `git checkout -f` deletes them without a word.

The other half is the ECAD constraint: a .kicad_pcb is an s-expression tree and cannot
be three-way merged textually. Git will happily produce a board neither author drew, so
`pull` is fast-forward only and a divergence is an error, not a merge commit.
