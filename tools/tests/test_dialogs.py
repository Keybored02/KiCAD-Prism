"""The agent's own dialogs.

These stand in front of cloning a repo, moving a working tree, and destroying
uncommitted work. So the property that matters is not that they look nice: it is that
**failing to ask is a NO**, never a silent yes. A URL handler that cannot open a window
must decline, not proceed.

The dialogs themselves need a display, so what is tested here is the decision logic and
the degradation, not the pixels.
