"""The version the package claims is the version the code reports.

It used to be a command-line argument that only reached metadata.json, so a build could
produce a zip PCM listed as 0.5.0 whose plugin told itself, and the server, that it was
0.4.0. Nothing failed: the panel showed the old number and the update check compared
the wrong one.

So the version is read from the source, and the plugin and agent are required to agree
with each other before anything is built.
