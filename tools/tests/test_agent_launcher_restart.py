"""restart_agent stops the running agent and starts THIS plugin's own binary,
never /restart (which asks the running process to re-exec itself).

The bug this replaced: the Settings dialog's restart button called /restart, which
for an OUTDATED agent just relaunches the same old version, having changed nothing.
The user saw "restart" silently do nothing and had to stop, then start, by hand,
two clicks doing what one button already promised. See agent_launcher.py's module
comment for the full story; this is the one place both call sites (the outdated-
agent card and the Settings dialog) now share.

No real HTTP server here: restart_agent only ever calls AgentClient().quit() and
.health(), so a fake AgentClient standing in for both exercises the exact call
sequence without a real socket, side-stepping a genuine Windows loopback flake
(BaseHTTPRequestHandler + rapid successive requests intermittently raises
ConnectionAbortedError client-side, unrelated to restart_agent's own logic).
