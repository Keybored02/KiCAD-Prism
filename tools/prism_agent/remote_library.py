"""Is Prism registered as KiCad's remote symbol provider?

KiCad keeps the registration in **eeschema.json**, under `remote_symbols`:

    "remote_symbols": {
        "providers": [
            {
                "provider_id": "provider-<12 hex>",
                "metadata_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000",
                "display_name_override": "Prism",
                "last_account_label": "",
                "last_auth_status": "signed_out"
            }
        ],
        ...
    }

`metadata_url` is the Prism server. If it's missing, or it names a *different* server
than the agent is configured for, the link is stale and the user should re-link.

Writing this works whether or not KiCad is running. KiCad does rewrite eeschema.json when
it exits, but only the sections it actually touched, and it doesn't touch
`remote_symbols.providers` unless the user opens the Remote Symbol dialog. So an external
write survives. (Verified the hard way: written with KiCad open, survived a full restart.)

KiCad reads the providers at startup, so the user has to restart KiCad to *see* a change.
That's the only caveat, and it's the one the UI should state.

`metadata_url` is not always `server_url` verbatim. KiCad refuses a provider URL that
isn't HTTPS or a literal loopback host, no config escape hatch, so a plain HTTP server
on the LAN, which is most of what this project is actually deployed as, fails outright.
When the user opts into the local bridge (settings.library_bridge_enabled), what gets
written is the bridge's own 127.0.0.1 URL instead, see library_bridge.py and
_metadata_url below. Every comparison against what is already in eeschema.json goes
through the same function, or a bridge left running from a previous link would show as
permanently "stale" against the raw server_url.
