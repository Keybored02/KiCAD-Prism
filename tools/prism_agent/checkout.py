"""Getting a specific commit, branch or tag into the working tree, safely.

"Open this commit" sounds like a one-liner and is not. A checkout moves the files under
KiCad while KiCad may have them open, and it can destroy uncommitted work. Almost all of
this module is the guards, and that is the right proportion.

The rule everything here follows: **never destroy work the user cannot get back.**

A commit is recoverable from git. An uncommitted edit is not. So anything that would
discard uncommitted changes is refused, with a reason and a way forward, rather than
done with a warning. `git checkout` itself is not this careful: it will happily carry
your dirty files onto another branch, and `git checkout -f` will silently delete them.

What is checked, and why each one matters:

  no repo             nothing to check out from
  unknown ref         a typo or a commit from a branch you never fetched: say which
  uncommitted changes the one that loses data. Refused, always.
  unmerged paths      a conflict is already in progress; moving now compounds it
  mid-operation       a rebase/merge/cherry-pick is half-done; git's own state is
                      partial and a checkout leaves it inconsistent
  detached HEAD       fine, but the user should be told they are not on a branch
  KiCad has it open   we cannot detect this reliably, so we say it plainly instead
