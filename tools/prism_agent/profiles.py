"""The agent's run profiles, in one place both the agent and the plugin read.

A profile is a named environment the agent and plugin run as. Two exist so a
developer can run a symlinked working copy AND the installed release at once
without them colliding: each profile has its own discovery file, settings,
single-instance lock, preferred port, and KiCad plugin identity.

Kept deliberately stdlib-only and free of any other project import, because the
KiCad plugin imports it from inside KiCad's Python, which is not this repo's
virtualenv. Everything here must work from a bare interpreter.

Selection order, resolved by ``resolve``:
1. an explicit name passed on the command line (``--profile``),
2. the ``PRISM_PROFILE`` environment variable,
3. auto-detection: a source checkout (the build script is a sibling) is "dev",
   anything else is "release".
