"""Opening a Prism project on this machine: `prism://open/<id>`.

Everything phases 1 to 3 built exists to make this one function honest:

    have it?  -> open it in KiCad
    not?      -> ask to clone; the user picks where; then open it
    no git?   -> say so; do not pretend

The client never asks where the *server* keeps its copy, and never compares paths. It
looks for a `.prism.json` marker under the user's projects roots.

When it does not have the project, it offers to clone -- but only the project's own
Prism-known `origin_url`, and only if that is a genuine remote (https/ssh/git). Prism is
a reader here, not a repo host: it never clones an arbitrary URL and never clones from
its own disk. The clone is a standard `git clone` that uses the user's local git
credentials; the user chooses the folder, and a folder outside the configured roots is
added to the project list (and the user is told). If anything fails, the error names
git's reason and the manual way to finish.
