"""Adding a KiCad .gitignore to a project that hasn't got one.

`adopt` writes one when it publishes a folder, so anything Prism created or adopted is
fine. A project that was IMPORTED never got one, and the result is a repo that reports
KiCad's churn as uncommitted work forever: caches, lock files, backups and fetched
libraries, none of which anyone chose to have.

That is not cosmetic. It makes "you have uncommitted changes" meaningless, so the user
learns to ignore the warning for the one time it matters, and it makes "discard my
changes" ill-defined, because the pile is churn and design work mixed together.

The patterns live in the backend's kicad_noise_service, beside the filter that hides the
same files from the history. Same knowledge, said once.

Two things this does NOT do:

  * It does not commit. Writing a file is easy to undo; committing on someone's behalf
    is a change to shared history they did not ask for.
  * It does not untrack anything, ever. An ignore rule only affects files git is not
    already tracking, so a project that COMMITTED its .kicad_prl keeps reporting it, and
    that is correct: somebody chose to commit it, and reversing that is not ours to do
    even with a prompt. We report which files are in that position; we do not touch them.
