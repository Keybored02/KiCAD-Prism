"""`prism://` deep links.

Two separable halves:

  * **Dispatch**, parsing a prism:// URL and acting on it. Portable, pure Python.
  * **Registration**, telling the OS that *we* handle the scheme. NOT portable:
    every platform does it differently, and one of them can't do it at all from a
    plain script.

Registration, per platform. All three are per-user, and all three work:

  Windows   a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\prism. No admin needed.
  Linux     a .desktop file declaring MimeType=x-scheme-handler/prism, then
            update-desktop-database.
  macOS     an .app bundle in ~/Applications whose Info.plist declares
            CFBundleURLTypes. LaunchServices genuinely will not read the scheme from
            anywhere else, so a bare `python -m prism_agent` cannot claim it.

            But an .app is just a DIRECTORY with a plist and an executable. Nothing
            about it is privileged: no Apple account, no signing, no notarisation.
            So we build one at opt-in time, containing a shell script that hands the
            URL back to the agent. No .app needs to be shipped.

Nothing here runs unless the user opts in (settings.protocol_handler). Claiming a
URL scheme behind someone's back is exactly the sort of thing people resent.

The URL grammar:

    prism://open/<project_id>            open a project HERE, in KiCad, cloning it
                                         first if this machine doesn't have it
    prism://web/<project_id>             open a project in the web app instead
    prism://ping                         prove the scheme is registered
    prism://auth/callback?code=...       OIDC redirect lands back here

`open` means "open it on this machine". That is the point of a desktop agent: if you
wanted the web app you would have followed a web link. `web` is the escape hatch.

    directory, not ours, so `-m prism_agent` alone can't import. Bootstrap sys.path
    explicitly rather than relying on cwd or PYTHONPATH, neither of which we
    control at the moment the OS invokes us.

    The PROFILE has to be baked in too, and forgetting it was a real bug. The OS
    launches this handler as a fresh process with none of our environment, so a dev
    agent (PRISM_PROFILE=dev) would register a command that runs with NO profile. The
    handler then read a different settings file than the agent that registered it:
    different server, no projects roots, and "no projects folder is set" for folders the
    user had just added. The profile is part of *which agent this is*, so it belongs in
    the command, not in an environment we do not control.

# It also does not deliver a scheme invocation as argv. It sends a kAEGetURL Apple
# Event, over the Mach-port channel a Cocoa run loop listens on, so the bundle needs a
# real Apple-Event-capable process behind it, not just a plist and any executable. An
# earlier version of this used a `#!/bin/sh` shim as CFBundleExecutable: LaunchServices
# launched it without complaint, but a bare shell script has no run loop and no Apple
# Event handler, so the URL arrived at a process with nowhere to put it and was
# silently dropped every time (see _register_macos). An AppleScript applet, built with
# `osacompile`, is the smallest thing macOS ships that has both: `on open location` is
# wired to kAEGetURL for free, no Xcode, no compiled binary of our own to maintain
# across three architectures.
#
# Nothing about the bundle is privileged: no Apple account, no signing, no
# notarisation, no App Store. We build it in the user's own ~/Applications, at the
# moment they opt in.
#
# (This is separate from Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper only inspects files carrying
# com.apple.quarantine, which is set by the app that DOWNLOADS a file. Nothing here is
# downloaded, we write it locally, so the flag is never set and never checked.)
