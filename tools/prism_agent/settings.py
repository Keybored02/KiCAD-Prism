"""Persistent agent settings.

Lives next to the discovery file in the user's config dir, but is a *separate*
file on purpose: the discovery file is ephemeral runtime state (port, pid, a token
minted per run) and gets deleted on shutdown, whereas this is what the user chose
and must outlive the process.

Env vars still win over the file, so a dev pointing at a staging backend with
PRISM_URL doesn't have their saved setting silently overridden, or silently
overwrite it.
