"""KiCad-Prism plugin: registers the pcbnew toolbar action.

KiCad imports this package from its plugin directory and calls register() on any
ActionPlugin it finds. The plugin itself is a thin UI, all the real work (git,
project lookup, backend calls) lives in the tray agent, which runs whether or not
KiCad is open. See tools/README.md.

    THE bug this exists for: a PCM update overwrites our .py files but leaves the old
    install's __pycache__ alone, because it only touches files the new package
    contains. Python then decides the cache is current and imports it, so KiCad runs
    the version you just replaced. Observed on a 0.5.0 -> 0.5.1 update: version.py said
    0.5.1, version.cpython-311.pyc said 0.5.0, and the plugin reported itself as 0.5.0.
    Silent, and it makes every other version check meaningless.

    Python invalidates bytecode by comparing the source's mtime to the one recorded in
    the .pyc, which normally catches this. It does not here: PCM restores the zip's
    timestamps, so the freshly written .py can carry an mtime the old .pyc already
    knows about.

    So compare against our own VERSION instead. version.py is rewritten by every
    update, and a .pyc older than it cannot have been built from it. Runs before the
    first submodule import, since after that the stale code is already loaded.

    Best effort: a read-only directory or a locked file is not worth failing an import
    over, and the worst case is the behaviour we already have.

    A dev checkout has the repo's siblings next to it (build_agent.py, the agent

    This matters because a developer wants BOTH at once: a symlink to iterate on,
    and a real install to verify what users actually get. Without telling them
    apart, two identically-named plugins appear in the menu and you have no idea
    which one you just clicked, and the symlinked one has no bundled binary, so it
    quietly exercises the source fallback instead of the thing under test.

    *old* code, and the failure is baffling, because the file on disk plainly says
    otherwise. It bites hardest when the agent has moved on and the stale dialog reads a
    field the new agent no longer returns: a KeyError, and the dialog just won't open.

    Reloading here means edit, click, see the change, no KiCad restart. Only in a dev
