"""Cross-probe a changed item into KiCad itself, select it and zoom to it.

Clicking a change row should take you to that item *in the editor you're already
in*, not to a web page. Two different mechanisms are needed, because KiCad exposes
two very different APIs:

PCB (all versions)
    pcbnew.FocusOnItem(item) selects the item and centres the canvas on it. We
    resolve our diff item back to a real BOARD_ITEM by uuid (KIID), falling back
    to a footprint reference when the item has no usable uuid, segments, for
    instance, are keyed by geometry in the diff, not by uuid.

Schematic (not possible on any current KiCad, verified against 10.0.4)
    KiCad 8 has no schematic Python API at all; the plugin system is pcbnew-only.

    KiCad 9/10 added the IPC API, and it is tempting to conclude from kipy that
    selection is board-only, because kipy's Schematic class exposes no
    add_to_selection(). That inference is wrong, and worth not repeating: the
    selection commands are *generic editor commands*
    (kiapi.common.commands.AddToSelection), they take an ItemHeader whose
    DocumentSpecifier explicitly supports schematics (DOCTYPE_SCHEMATIC,
    sheet_path), and board.py's implementation does nothing board-specific, it
    just points the header at its own document.

    The real blocker is one layer deeper, and only KiCad can answer it. Sending
    those commands at a live schematic document on 10.0.4 returns:

        ApiError: no handler available for request of type
                  kiapi.common.commands.GetSelection

    while the identical commands against the open PCB document succeed. So the
    protocol defines selection for any document, but *eeschema has not implemented
    the handlers*. There is nothing to call, and no way to route around it.

    (Aside: kipy's Schematic wrapper doesn't even import on KiCad 10, it targets
    KiCad 11's protobufs and dies on `ImportError: BusEntryType`. Any future
    implementation here should talk the raw commands, not that wrapper.)

    Rather than ship a row that throws on first click, schematic rows are simply
    not clickable. When eeschema ships the handlers,
    schematic_probe_available() is the single place to flip.
