"""Start the tray agent from the plugin.

The agent ships as a **self-contained binary** next to this plugin, so starting it
is just running a file. That is the whole point: the plugin lives inside KiCad's
embedded Python, which has no pystray/Pillow, and we cannot assume the user has any
*other* Python, they installed a zip from the Plugin Manager and may never have run
pip. Hunting the machine for a suitable interpreter is what this used to do, and it
failed for exactly that person.

The Python path survives only as a **development fallback**, for running out of a
source checkout before a binary has been built.

Why launching it isn't a security escalation: the plugin already runs arbitrary
Python inside KiCad with the user's full rights, anything it could do by spawning
the agent, it could do inline. What *would* be a concern is launching an arbitrary
path from config, or auto-starting behind the user's back. So this only ever runs
our own binary, resolved relative to this file, and only when the user asks.
