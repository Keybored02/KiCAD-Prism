"""Entry point for the packaged agent binary.

PyInstaller runs its entry script as a top-level script, with no package context —
so pointing it straight at prism_agent/__main__.py fails on the first relative
import ("attempted relative import with no known parent package"). This module is
imported *as a package member's caller*, so `prism_agent` resolves normally.

Keep it trivial. Everything real lives in prism_agent.__main__.
