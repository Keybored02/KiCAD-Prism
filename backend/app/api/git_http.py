"""Git Smart HTTP, served on the port Prism already listens on.

    git clone https://prism.example.com/git/prj_abc.git

Why here rather than sshd or a separate git server: a client reaching a repo then goes
through the *same* auth as everything else in Prism. A parallel SSH key system is one
nobody remembers to revoke, and it would put access control somewhere Prism cannot see.

The implementation shells out to `git http-backend`, git's own CGI program. We are not
reimplementing the pack protocol; we are speaking CGI to the thing that already
implements it, correctly, including all the negotiation subtleties that make hand-rolled
git servers subtly wrong.

Two things git clients do that shape this file:

  * They authenticate with **HTTP Basic**, not Bearer. Git has no notion of a bearer
    token, so we accept a Prism API token as the Basic *password* and bridge it.
  * They expect a **401 with WWW-Authenticate** to know they should prompt for
    credentials. A 403 makes git give up without asking.
