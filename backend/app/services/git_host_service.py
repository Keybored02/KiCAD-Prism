"""Prism as a git origin: bare repositories it hosts itself.

This is model B. Prism stops being only a viewer of somebody else's git and becomes the
place git lives. Everything else in the storage plan already supports it, so this module
is small on purpose: a bare repo, and a way to reach it.

**Bare, and only on this side.** A bare repo has no working tree, which is exactly right
for an origin that several people push to: there is no checked-out copy for two users to
corrupt. A *client* clone is never bare, because KiCad opens files off the disk. Nothing
is ever converted from one to the other. When Prism adopts an existing repo it creates a
new bare repo and PUSHES into it; the user's working tree is untouched and simply gains
a remote.

**The transport is Smart HTTP**, served on the port Prism already listens on (see
api/git_http.py). That means one port, no sshd, no key management, and, most importantly,
that reaching a repo goes through the same auth as everything else in Prism rather than
a parallel system nobody remembers to revoke.
