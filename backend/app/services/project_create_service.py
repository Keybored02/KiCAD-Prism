"""Creating a project that Prism itself hosts (model B).

Two ways in, both landing in the same place: a bare repo Prism owns, a registered
project, and an `origin_url` a client can clone.

    create()  from nothing. A seeded KiCad skeleton, so the repo is openable
              immediately rather than being an empty directory.

    adopt()   from a folder the user already has. The tree is NOT moved and NOT
              converted; we create a bare repo, push the history into it, and set it as
              `origin`. The user keeps working where they were.

Both go through git_host_service, which owns the bare-repo mechanics.
