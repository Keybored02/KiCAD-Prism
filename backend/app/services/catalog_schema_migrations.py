"""Versioned, additive migrations for the component catalog schema.

The workspace schema has carried a migration ladder since it was introduced.
The catalog instead had a single version string, and an installation whose
database did not carry that exact string was told at startup to run
``scripts/reset_prism_postgres.py`` with destructive confirmation. That made the
first catalog schema change in any release equivalent to discarding every
component, revision, release record, review decision and asset row on the
installation -- and it would have surfaced for the first time on somebody's
production database, mid-upgrade, after the old stack had already been stopped.

Migrations here follow the same contract as
:mod:`app.services.workspace_schema_migrations`: numbered, additive and
idempotent, applied once under the caller's advisory lock and recorded in
``catalog_schema_versions``. An upgrade may only add. Anything that removes or
narrows waits for a later release, once the version that needed it is out of
support, so that rolling the application back does not require restoring data.

Derived state stays out of this ladder on purpose. The component-head
projections, search indexes and integrity guards are rebuilt whenever their
definition version changes, which a run-once ledger cannot express; they keep
their own version markers in ``catalog_meta``.
