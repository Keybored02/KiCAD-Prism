"""Files attached to review comments (issue #417).

A reviewer pastes or drops a file into the composer before the comment
exists, so uploads land as ``pending`` rows. Saving a root or reply links
every ``attachment:<id>`` reference in its Markdown body; a pending upload
nobody links is swept after ``PENDING_TTL``.

Blobs are content-addressed under ``attachment_root()`` and never live in the
project repository. Images are decoded and re-encoded before storage for the
same reason as uploaded thumbnails (``derived_assets.store_uploaded_thumbnail``):
Prism serves them back to every project member, so the stored bytes must be
only pixels, never a polyglot or the uploader's EXIF block.
