"""Role visibility for systems and their child projects (§8.2).

A system inherits its folder's visibility with the predicate
``WorkspaceService.get_project_for_role`` uses for projects, so a folder that
hides a project from a role hides a system placed there too. This module only
needs a connection, so the workspace listing can call it without importing
the System Builder service.
