"""PostgreSQL persistence for System Builder (``docs/system-builder/CONTRACTS.md`` §5).

``SystemStore`` wraps a connection the caller owns; it never commits. Every
change to a system's engineering state happens inside ``store.mutation(...)``,
which:

* locks the ``system_projects`` row, so concurrent mutations of one system
  serialize;
* checks the caller's expected version (the ETag, §8), raising
  ``StaleVersion`` with the current version when it differs;
* records audit events in the same transaction as the change (§10.2);
* bumps the version exactly once when the block exits cleanly.

Detection passes ``expected_version=None``: it has no ETag, but its changes
still move the version so an editor holding the old ETag gets 412.

The class is assembled from mixins by area (``store_instances``,
``store_harnesses``, ``store_reviews``) over ``store_base.StoreCore``; callers
keep importing the limits and errors from this module.

Reviews are opened and superseded here for detection (SYS-06), decided for
reconcile (SYS-07), and snapshots are frozen here for SYS-09.
