"""System Builder application service: the SYS-04 CRUD surface of §8.

Each public method runs in one transaction, authorizes the caller against the
system (§8.2), applies O1 redaction, and turns ``SystemStore`` results into
the camelCase documents the API returns. Git lookups run before the
transaction; extraction jobs are enqueued after it commits.

Detection, reviews, validation, snapshots and imports arrive with their own
tickets (SYS-06 to SYS-10) and extend this service.

The class is assembled from mixins by area (``service_documents``,
``service_assemblies``, ``service_harnesses``, ``service_reviews``, ``service_git``) over
``service_base.ServiceCore``; callers keep importing from this module.

Documents are built unredacted (``_build``) and redacted for the reader last
(``redaction``), so a snapshot can freeze one document and serve it to any
reader later (§9.1).
